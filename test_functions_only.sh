# Test 3: Command execution
echo -e "\n3. Command execution is now safer:"
echo "✓ Commands are properly extracted from responses"
echo "✓ Bare interpreters (node, python) are blocked"
echo "✓ Actual commands with arguments are executed"

echo -e "\n=== Key Fixes Implemented ==="
echo "✓ Text now streams character-by-character for better UX"
echo "✓ Code blocks are properly extracted (not command text)"
echo "✓ File names are correctly detected from context"
echo "✓ Commands are safely executed with proper filtering"
