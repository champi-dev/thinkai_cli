# Demo script showing ThinkAI CLI's enhanced capabilities

echo "ðŸš€ ThinkAI CLI Enhanced Capabilities Demo"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "This demo shows how the CLI can:"
echo "1. Create files from natural language"
echo "2. Execute commands intelligently"
echo "3. Build progressively while maintaining context"
echo "4. Parse complex responses with smart regex"
echo ""

# Demo 1: Basic coding
echo "Demo 1: Creating a Node.js API"
echo "Prompt: 'create an express API with user CRUD operations'"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Creates server.js with Express setup"
echo "- Adds GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints"
echo "- Includes proper error handling"
echo ""

# Demo 2: Progressive building
echo "Demo 2: Progressive Development"
echo "Step 1: 'create a react app with a header component'"
echo "Step 2: 'add a navigation menu to the header'"
echo "Step 3: 'add dark mode toggle to the navigation'"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Each step builds on previous work"
echo "- Context is maintained across commands"
echo "- Files are updated, not overwritten"
echo ""

# Demo 3: Smart command execution
echo "Demo 3: Intelligent Command Execution"
echo "Prompt: 'set up a python virtual environment and install flask'"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Detects Python project"
echo "- Creates virtual environment"
echo "- Activates it and installs dependencies"
echo "- Validates dangerous commands"
echo ""

# Demo 4: Enhanced parsing
echo "Demo 4: Smart Response Parsing"
echo "The enhanced parser can detect:"
echo "- Multiple code blocks in one response"
echo "- Various filename mention formats"
echo "- Command patterns (npm, git, python, etc.)"
echo "- Context clues for progressive coding"
echo ""

# Show how to run the demos
echo "To run these demos:"
echo ""
echo "1. Basic CLI (original fixed version):"
echo "   ./int.sh"
echo ""
echo "2. Smart CLI (with enhanced parsing):"
echo "   ./int_smart.sh"
echo ""
echo "3. Run automated tests:"
echo "   ./test/e2e_progressive_coding.sh"
echo ""

# Provide example conversation
echo "Example Progressive Coding Session:"

> create a task management API with express
[CLI creates server.js with basic Express setup and task endpoints]

> add authentication middleware using JWT
[CLI adds auth.js and updates server.js with authentication]

> add a database connection using MongoDB
[CLI adds db.js and updates models without breaking existing code]

> create unit tests for the task endpoints
[CLI creates test files that work with the existing structure]
