Certainly! Below is a simple `hello.js` file that will print "Hello World" when you run it. This example assumes you're using Node.js, which is the most common runtime environment for JavaScript files.

```javascript
// hello.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

To run this file:

1. Save the code above in a text editor or IDE and save it as `hello.js`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.js`.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   node hello.js
   ```

You should see "Hello World" printed in the console.

If you are using a different environment, such as running this script directly from your browser or another JavaScript runtime, please let me know so I can provide more specific instructions!
