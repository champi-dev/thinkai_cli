# CLIII Conversation Context Feature

## Overview

The CLIII (Command Line Interface) has been enhanced with **eternal conversation context persistence**, enabling the CLI to maintain conversation history across sessions and provide contextual responses based on previous interactions.

## Key Features

### 1. **Persistent Conversation Storage**
- All conversations are stored permanently in `~/.cliii/conversations/`
- Each conversation is saved as a JSON file with unique ID
- Messages include timestamps and role identification (user/assistant)

### 2. **Context-Aware Responses**
- The last 10 messages are automatically included as context in API calls
- The AI can reference previous messages within the same conversation
- Context enables more coherent and personalized interactions

### 3. **Session Management Commands**
- `/new` - Create a new conversation
- `/list` - Display all available conversations
- `/switch <id>` - Switch to a different conversation
- `/history` - View current conversation history
- `/clear` - Clear the screen (keeps conversation)

### 4. **Automatic Session Recovery**
- Current conversation ID stored in `~/.cliii/current_conversation`
- Automatically resumes last conversation on startup
- Gracefully handles interrupted sessions

## Implementation Details

### Storage Structure
```
~/.cliii/
├── conversations/
│   ├── conv_20241214_143022_12345.json
│   ├── conv_20241214_150133_23456.json
│   └── ...
└── current_conversation
```

### Conversation JSON Format
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_20241214_143022_12345",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, how are you?",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-14T14:30:22Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm doing well, thank you!",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-14T14:30:23Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Integration
The `send_to_thinkai()` function now includes:
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation
- `context`: Array of recent messages (last 10)
- Original message content

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Conversation
```bash
$ ./int.sh
Welcome to ThinkAI CLI with conversation persistence!
Commands: /new, /list, /switch <id>, /history, /clear, exit
Current conversation: conv_20241214_143022_12345
> /new
Created new conversation: conv_20241214_150133_23456
> Hello, I'm Alice
```

### Resuming a Previous Conversation
```bash
$ ./int.sh
Current conversation: conv_20241214_143022_12345
> What did we discuss earlier?
[AI responds with context from previous messages]
```

### Managing Multiple Conversations
```bash
> /list
Available conversations:
  conv_20241214_143022_12345 - Messages: 10, Last: 2024-12-14T14:35:00Z
  conv_20241214_150133_23456 - Messages: 5, Last: 2024-12-14T15:10:00Z
> /switch conv_20241214_143022_12345
Switched to conversation: conv_20241214_143022_12345
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with comprehensive report
./test/run_all_tests.sh

# Run specific test suites
./test/test_conversation_context.sh  # E2E tests
./test/test_edge_cases.sh           # Edge case tests
```

### Test Coverage
- **E2E Tests**: 7 comprehensive scenarios covering all features
- **Edge Cases**: 10 stress tests for robustness
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)

### Verified Capabilities
✅ Messages persist across sessions
✅ Context influences AI responses
✅ Multiple conversation management
✅ Special character handling
✅ Large message support (10KB+)
✅ Concurrent access safety
✅ Corruption recovery
✅ Performance with 100+ messages
✅ 50+ simultaneous conversations

## Technical Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Natural, continuous conversations
   - No need to repeat context
   - Resume conversations anytime

2. **Reliability**
   - Atomic file operations prevent corruption
   - Graceful error handling
   - Session recovery after crashes

3. **Performance**
   - Efficient JSON storage
   - Context window limiting (last 10 messages)
   - Fast conversation switching

4. **Security**
   - Path traversal protection
   - JSON injection prevention
   - Safe handling of special characters

## Future Enhancements

- Conversation search functionality
- Export conversations to different formats
- Conversation archiving/deletion
- Configurable context window size
- Multi-user support with conversation sharing
